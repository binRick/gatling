=======

Gatling is a minimal message queue written in C. It's extremely simple: clients subscribe and publish messages to topics. This was written for fun over a single weekend, so it provide no guaranteesâ€”use at your own risk!

This repo includes a basic Python client that can be used to interact with the broker. There's also a [Go client](https://github.com/tylertreat/gatling-gun) available.
